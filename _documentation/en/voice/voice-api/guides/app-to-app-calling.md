# Using the Client SDK for App to App Calling

The Vonage Client SDK allows you to build Programmable Conversation applications.

Using the Conversation API and the Client SDK you can build complete applications that feature two-way voice and messaging communications. Whereas the [Conversation API](/conversation/overview) can be used directly to build out the backend of your Programmable Conversation application, the Client SDK enables you to quickly build the client-side application. The backend usually deals with tasks such as managing users in a database, the generation of tokens for those users, and the creation of the [Conversations](/conversation/concepts/conversation). The client-side provides methods to log users into Vonage, and handle the various [Events](/conversation/concepts/event) that are generated as communication takes place. Other client-side functions include generating member invites if required, displaying typing indicators, and handling voice call operations such as inbound call, making a call, a user hanging up, and so on.

Client SDK enables communications across multiple [Channels](/conversation/concepts/channel) including voice. This can be used to make a phone call from one app to another app; a tutorial is available in the following languages:

* [JavaScript](/client-sdk/tutorials/app-to-phone/introduction/javascript)
* [Kotlin](/client-sdk/tutorials/app-to-phone/introduction/javascript)
