# Handle Incoming Calls

The Voice provider's `onInboundCall` function allows you to handle incoming calls using the [Voice API](/voice/voice-api/overview).

## Method Signature
```javascript
onInboundCall(callback: string, to: ChannelPhoneEndpoint, from?: ChannelPhoneEndpoint)
```

### Types

This function uses the NeRu `ChannelPhoneEndpoint` type for the caller and recipient of the call.

## Handle Calls

Omitting the `from` parameter, you can handle any incoming calls to a specified Vonage number. Incoming calls will call the `onCall` route.
