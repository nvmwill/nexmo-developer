# NeRu Secrets

NeRu Secrets allow you to store sensitive information for use in your projects. Secrets are managed through the NeRu CLI.

## Creating a Secret

To create a secret, you can use the NeRu CLI secrets create command.

```sh
neru secrets create --name <name> --value <value>
```

So to create a secret `FOO` with the value `bar`:

```sh
neru secrets create --name FOO --value bar
```

You can also add files as secrets:

```sh
neru secrets create --name <name> --file <path/to/file>
```

## Accessing your Secrets

To access a secret in your instance, you need to add it to your configuration file to expose it. Add a `environment` key to your configuration file with a list of the secrets you want to expose and a name to refer to them by:

```yml
project:
    name: neru-app
instance:
    name: dev
    runtime: nodejs16
    region: aws.euw1
    application-id: fcd08ece-f3c2-4adf-bf84-5ba8a1c86e0e
    capabilities: [voice, messages]
    entrypoint: [node, index.js]
    environment:
        - name: FOO_SECRET
          secret: FOO
        - name: BAZ_SECRET
          secret: BAZ
```

Now that the secret is in your configuration file, they will be injected into your instance when you run the NeRu debugger or deploy your project. So for the above example of `FOO`:

```javascript
const fooValue = process.env.FOO_SECRET;
```

## Updating Secrets

Updating secrets works similarly to creating secrets, but to update you use `neru secrets update`:

```sh
neru secrets update --name <name> --value <changed-value>
```

To update the `FOO` example:

```sh
neru secrets update --name FOO --value baz
```

## Removing Secrets

Secrets can be removed using `neru secrets remove`:

```sh
neru secrets remove <secret_name>
```

To remove the `FOO` example:

```sh
neru secrets remove FOO
```

## Working with Secrets Locally

When you are debugging your project locally, you will not have access to the secrets stored on the NeRu platform. It is recommended that you create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your development secrets there:

```
export FOO=BAR
export BAZ=BAT
export X=Y
```

Then before you start debugging run:

```
source .env
```

> The environment variables need to be set in the same shell process that you are running the NeRu debugger in. 

This will export the development secrets in your current terminal shell process, allowing the NeRu debugger to access them.
